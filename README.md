## While each operation is in progress, nothing else can happen â€“ the processing (display) of the document is suspended. This is because JavaScript is single-threaded.

+ ## There are two types of asynchronous code style you'll encounter in JavaScript code, the old method called callbacks and the newer method called promises. In the following sections, we will get to know each of them.
# > New Promise
## In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out whether the asynchronous operation has completed successfully or not.
